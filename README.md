This is the introduction scene to Jordan Mechner's Prince of Persia, done on the TRS-80 Color Computer 3. This recreation was from the DOS VGA version released in 1989. 

One thing to keep in mind while watching this demo, the PC version was done with VGA graphics, a Sound Blaster card for 16-bit audio, and an 8088/8086 processor running at least at 4.77MHz minimum. This recreation was done on a 1.78MHz 6809 CPU with no hardware sprites, or hardware based sound chip - it's 100% CPU. I'd like to continue to develop the full game, since I believe the Color Computer is probably the only 8-bit platform that hasn't had a port done - if I do take it further, I plan to keep it as close to the DOS VGA version as possible.
